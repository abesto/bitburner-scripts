spread out ticks of target servers across a tick to minimize impact of runtime variance on latter hacks
  needs a stable offset per server (modulo server limit). hash the server name (and store it, as micro-optimization).
stopping processes via Worker seems to not work?
"shutting down hacks" probably doesn't cancel scheduled tasks in the Scheduler
  maybe we shouldn't shut running stuff down, we already paid for part of it, may as well get the value
another optimization pass
grafana through downloaded files?
